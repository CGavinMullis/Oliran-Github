# A Coming of Age

## Intro
The residents within the Village of Birds are wary of outsiders and value courage above all else. In order to pass through the magical barrier surrounding the village, individuals must first pass a Trial of Courage. The Trial of Courage can be found in a cave west of the Village of Birds. Before passing the Trial ,entrance to the village is impossible. Marshall, a small birdfolk, can provide further information on the trial, clan, and village.

## Information Marshall Has
Young birds are not allowed to leave the Village of Birds, but once they hit the age of 12, they are forced to leave and complete the Trial of Courage. Without completing the Trial they can never re-enter the village.

Marshall, a shy timid fellow, never completed this trial but managed to find his way to Mermaid's landing where he made some connections with Chicken Joe and opened up his shop Wings & Things.

Young birds have heard rumors that the trial is different depending on the individual. The only thing that stays the same is that all meet the Father Bird and recieve a small seed as proof of their success in completing the trial. This seed seems to be what allows passage through the magical barrier protecting the Village of Birds.

Marshall is familiar with the Bird Beak Root. It grows around one specific portion along Misty Run where the Village of Birds is located and it is cultivated by the Villagers for its medicinal properties.

Marshall is unsure if outsiders can attempt the Trial as he has never heard about it, but he is optimistic that upon completion of the trial the party could enter the village. If the party is still unable to enter the village after completing the trial, Marshall offers to bring the root to the party himself. However, Marshall won't complete the trial alone.

## Traveling to the Cave of Snakes

Before reaching the halfway mark, the Village of Birds, a hooded figure stalks the party.

* Perception DC 15: You have a strange feeling that you are being followed

* Perception DC 18: Additionally, you notice the birds have become quiet.

* Perception DC 20: Additionally, you see a dark cloaked figure dart away into the thick jungle as you turn around.

The Rest of the Trek is uneventful

## Village of Birds
![The Village of Birds](https://github.com/CGavinMullis/Oliran-Github/blob/main/Atlas/Continental/Velik/Titurel-Island/Local/Scene/The-Village-Of-Birds.jpg)

Bulbous homes crafted of animal hide and palm wood can be seen along the banks of a small brook. Mist can be seen wafting out of the water and along the immediate edges. A few bird folk can be seen working around the village. 

* Perception DC 13: A semi-transparent shimmering barrier can be seen surrounding the village.

* Perception DC 15: While you can see people talking on the other side of the barrier, you notice that you cannot hear anything they are saying. No sound is passing through the barrier.

* Aracana DC 14: You get the idea that this magic is similar to a well known spell "Wall of Force".

* Aracana DC 16: You understand that this spell must be much more powerful to account for the conditional affects that apply to the wall as well as its size. Either a great mage is casting this spell constantly or something else magical is powering it.

* Arcana DC 18: You sense that this barrier also blocks teleport spells and scrying spells.

* Nature DC 13: You are able to make out the Bird Beak Root groing on the edge of the brook due to its distinctive shape from otherroot varieties.

Attempting to attack, ram, break, or otherwise get through the barrier results in 1d4 force damage reflecting back at the attacker.

## Traveling to the Cave of Snakes Part 2
![Cave of Snakes Upper Ruins](https://github.com/CGavinMullis/Oliran-Github/blob/main/Atlas/Continental/Velik/Titurel-Island/Local/Scene/Snake-Cave-Ruins.jpg)
The party continues past the Village of Birds following Marshal towards the Trial of Courage

* Perception DC 18: You notice the birds have become quiet again.

* Perception DC 20: You again feel like you are being watched.

The walk is shorter than the first half and uneventful.

The party comes upon the ruins of a large ancient temple. Weather worn stone can be seen scattered around the area covered in vines, moss, and tree roots. Sunlight can be seen streaming through the surrounding palm trees. A faint smell of still water and wet dirt wafts from the center of the ruins. Water asynchronously dripping onto stone can also be heard from ahead and below. 

## Cave of Snakes Entrance
![Cave of Snakes](https://github.com/CGavinMullis/Oliran-Github/blob/main/Atlas/Continental/Velik/Titurel-Island/Local/Scene/Snake-Cave.jpg)

Once in the center of the ruins, a section of caved in floor reveals a large moss covered statue resembling a snake about 25 feet from the upper level. The floor below the statue cannot be seen. Only water of an unknown depth is seen below the structure about 100 feet down. Along the edge of the hole are wet vines hanging down about 50 ft.

### Jumping onto the statue
The statue looks slick with moss.

* Acrobatics DC 14 or less: You land on the nose of the statue but slip on the moss and slide down the statue into the water below.

* Acrobatics DC 15: You are able to land on the nose of the statue safely.

### Jumping into the water
The depth of the water can not be seen from above. By dropping a sharp stick or similar object into the water a depth of about 30 ft can be estimated.

### Climbing down the Vines

* Athletics DC 14 or less: You slide down the wet vine unable to get a good grip and fall into the water below.

* Athletics DC 15: You manage to lower yourself to the bottom of the Vine without losing your grip.

## First Encounter

The party enters a room with stone walls and two stone braziers that light themselves as they enter. Some moss can be seen near the entrance and the air here is very stale. On the opposite wall of the entrance words written in birdfolk can be seen. 

*A Hearty Jaunt*\
*A Leap of Faith*\
*Run Fast Through Me*\
*To Enter This Place*\
