# A Coming of Age

## Intro
The residents within the Village of Birds are wary of outsiders and value courage above all else. In order to pass through the magical barrier surrounding the village, individuals must first pass a Trial of Courage. The Trial of Courage can be found in a cave west of the Village of Birds. Before passing the Trial ,entrance to the village is impossible. Marshall, a small birdfolk, can provide further information on the trial, clan, and village.

## Information Marshall Has
Young birds are not allowed to leave the Village of Birds, but once they hit the age of 12, they are forced to leave and complete the Trial of Courage. Without completing the Trial they can never re-enter the village.

Marshall, a shy timid fellow, never completed this trial but managed to find his way to Mermaid's landing where he made some connections with Chicken Joe and opened up his shop Wings & Things.

Young birds have heard rumors that the trial is different depending on the individual. The only thing that stays the same is that all meet the Father Bird and recieve a small seed as proof of their success in completing the trial. This seed seems to be what allows passage through the magical barrier protecting the Village of Birds.
