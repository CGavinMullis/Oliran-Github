## Intro
The residents within the Village of Birds are wary of outsiders and value courage above all else. In order to pass through the magical barrier surrounding the village, individuals must first pass a Trial of Courage. The Trial of Courage can be found in a cave west of the Village of Birds. Before passing the Trial ,entrance to the village is impossible. Marshall, a small birdfolk, can provide further information on the trial, clan, and village.

## Wings & Things
![Wings & Things](https://github.com/CGavinMullis/Oliran-Github/blob/main/Atlas/Continental/Velik/Titurel-Island/Local/Scene/Wings-And-Things.jpg)

![Marshall](https://github.com/CGavinMullis/Oliran-Github/blob/main/Characters/NPCs/VINPCs/Marshall/Marshall.jpg)
## Information Marshall Has
Young birds are not allowed to leave the Village of Birds, but once they hit the age of 12, they are forced to leave and complete the Trial of Courage. Without completing the Trial they can never re-enter the village.

Marshall, a shy timid fellow, never completed this trial but managed to find his way to Mermaid's landing where he made some connections with Chicken Joe and opened up his shop Wings & Things.

Young birds have heard rumors that the trial is different depending on the individual. The only thing that stays the same is that all meet the Father Bird and recieve a small seed as proof of their success in completing the trial. This seed seems to be what allows passage through the magical barrier protecting the Village of Birds.

Marshall is familiar with the Bird Beak Root. It grows around one specific portion along Misty Run where the Village of Birds is located and it is cultivated by the Villagers for its medicinal properties.

Marshall is unsure if outsiders can attempt the Trial as he has never heard about it, but he is optimistic that upon completion of the trial the party could enter the village. If the party is still unable to enter the village after completing the trial, Marshall offers to bring the root to the party himself. However, Marshall won't complete the trial alone.

## Traveling to the Cave of Snakes
![Path-To-The-Village-Of-Birds](https://github.com/CGavinMullis/Oliran-Github/blob/main/Atlas/Continental/Velik/Titurel-Island/Local/Scene/Path-To-The-Village-Of-Birds.png)

Before reaching the halfway mark, the Village of Birds, a hooded figure stalks the party.

* Perception DC 15: You have a strange feeling that you are being followed

* Perception DC 18: Additionally, you notice the birds have become quiet.

* Perception DC 20: Additionally, you see a dark cloaked figure dart away into the thick jungle as you turn around.

The Rest of the Trek is uneventful

## Village of Birds
![The Village of Birds](https://github.com/CGavinMullis/Oliran-Github/blob/main/Atlas/Continental/Velik/Titurel-Island/Local/Scene/The-Village-Of-Birds.jpg)

Bulbous homes crafted of animal hide and palm wood can be seen along the banks of a small brook. Mist can be seen wafting out of the water and along the immediate edges. A few bird folk can be seen working around the village. 

* Perception DC 13: A semi-transparent shimmering barrier can be seen surrounding the village.

* Perception DC 15: While you can see people talking on the other side of the barrier, you notice that you cannot hear anything they are saying. No sound is passing through the barrier.

* Aracana DC 14: You get the idea that this magic is similar to a well known spell "Wall of Force".

* Aracana DC 16: You understand that this spell must be much more powerful to account for the conditional affects that apply to the wall as well as its size. Either a great mage is casting this spell constantly or something else magical is powering it.

* Arcana DC 18: You sense that this barrier also blocks teleport spells and scrying spells.

* Nature DC 13: You are able to make out the Bird Beak Root groing on the edge of the brook due to its distinctive shape from otherroot varieties.

Attempting to attack, ram, break, or otherwise get through the barrier results in 1d4 force damage reflecting back at the attacker.

## Traveling to the Cave of Snakes Part 2
![Cave of Snakes Upper Ruins](https://github.com/CGavinMullis/Oliran-Github/blob/main/Atlas/Continental/Velik/Titurel-Island/Local/Scene/Snake-Cave-Ruins.jpg)
The party continues past the Village of Birds following Marshal towards the Trial of Courage

* Perception DC 18: You notice the birds have become quiet again.

* Perception DC 20: You again feel like you are being watched.

The walk is shorter than the first half and uneventful.

The party comes upon the ruins of a large ancient temple. Weather worn stone can be seen scattered around the area covered in vines, moss, and tree roots. Sunlight can be seen streaming through the surrounding palm trees. A faint smell of still water and wet dirt wafts from the center of the ruins. Water asynchronously dripping onto stone can also be heard from ahead and below. 

## Cave of Snakes Entrance
![Cave of Snakes](https://github.com/CGavinMullis/Oliran-Github/blob/main/Atlas/Continental/Velik/Titurel-Island/Local/Scene/Snake-Cave.jpg)

Once in the center of the ruins, a section of caved in floor reveals a large moss covered statue resembling a snake about 25 feet from the upper level. The floor below the statue cannot be seen. Only water of an unknown depth is seen below the structure about 100 feet down. Along the edge of the hole are wet vines hanging down about 50 ft.

### Jumping onto the statue
The statue looks slick with moss.

* Acrobatics DC 14 or less: You land on the nose of the statue but slip on the moss and slide down the statue into the water below.

* Acrobatics DC 15: You are able to land on the nose of the statue safely.

### Jumping into the water
The depth of the water can not be seen from above. By dropping a sharp stick or similar object into the water a depth of about 30 ft can be estimated.

### Climbing down the Vines

* Athletics DC 14 or less: You slide down the wet vine unable to get a good grip and fall into the water below.

* Athletics DC 15: You manage to lower yourself to the bottom of the Vine without losing your grip.

## First Encounter

The party enters a room with stone walls and two stone braziers that light themselves as they enter. Some moss can be seen near the entrance and the air here is very stale. On the opposite wall of the entrance words written in birdfolk can be seen. 

*A Hearty Jaunt*\
*A Leap of Faith*\
*Run Fast Through Me*\
*To Enter This Place*\

Arcana Checks will discern minor illusion from the text on the wall. The Wall is otherwise solid and appears to be as a normal wall. Only upon fully running into the wall does a shimmering door appear on the surface of the wall after the runner first takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage.

As one person passes through the door the door slams shut behind them. If two people try to pass through simultaneously or partially enter and view the interior they will see different interiors.

## Varis Trial

### Location: Lost City of Jehkid

The room starts with a series of stairs leading down to a narrow sandstone bridge with strange raised edges almost as if its carved out like a bowl. Below the sandstone bridge carved rock spears can be seen. Along the walls of the room, 4 groups of holes can be seen in the sandstone, always in groups of 3x3 (a total of 9 per group). At the end of the bridge, a large statue (The Lost One) of a 3 Elephant Headed Humanoid sits criss cross with arms outstretched, a stone snake coiled around their feet. In one hand rests a massive triple headed flail. In the other hand, rests a linen bag overflowing with grain. Around the statue are several small carved elephants. They consist of several different colors and materials. Some are carved of expensive stone others are carved of wood and painted. Some consist of several sticks bound together by twine. 

* Marble Elephant
* Wooden Twigs and Silken Twine
* Willow Elephant with Painted Polka Dots

Upon entering the room the voice of Rabin can be heard calling from ahead "I believe this is the destination you Men were looking for."
Immediately to your left is Ruzanack Rebelly readjusting his pack on his shoulders.
The Cool Dry air hits your nostrils as you immediately notice the smell of stale still air. Besides the sounds of yourself, Rabin, & Ruznack the room is eerily quiet.
Ruznack immediately takes the lead approcing Rabin who is standing at the beginning of the bridge and attempts to pass him and cross the bridge.

### The Encounter

While the Sandstone is carved out several pressure plates exist on the bridge. Four of the pressure plates exist in front of the carved out holes and will trigger the poison dart traps from the sides when at least 20 lbs of weight is placed on them.

![Arbor Blacksand](https://github.com/CGavinMullis/Oliran-Github/blob/main/Characters/NPCs/Generic-NPCs/Arbor-Blacksand/Arbor-Blacksand.jpg)

## Encounter

* The professor explains mostly history of the lost Yuan-Ti Civilization
* Arbor Blacksand primarliy explains about the environmental changes

* The professor explains that the first known sentient people of Oliran were know as the creators. It is unknown if this was aname given to them by themselves or simply a mistranslation by human and elven scholars. These races consisted of Sarurkh, a humanoid-reptilian top half and snake bottom; Batarichi, an amphibiod race; Aearee, a winged bird beak race; the fey, a mix of Korreds, pixies, and sprites; and Humans. Only the Sarrukh, Batarachi, and earee had large empires.

* Abor explains that the continents looked much different back then. These creator races used magic and labor to teraform their lands to fit their needs instead of leaving them alone. Disastrous Calamities occured due to this terraforming. Earthquakes, dust storms spanning a continent, floods that would wipe out entire land masses, fires removing entire jungles. Entire contients were erased and the seas rearranged. 

* THe professor explains that on top of this terraforming, some legends say they intended to rearrange the stars once they were done with Oliran. The extreme climate change wiped out most of the Batarachi, but the Sarrukh thrived and claimed the new land for themselves. Experiments were done by the Sarrukh to create slaves.Humans were captured, tortued, and experimented on. A serpent like, humanoid was created the Yuan-Ti. From the scripts I have gathered it seems that they had a very hierarchyical structure. Those will more prominent snake like features were regarded as higher class while those more humanoid were sent to spy on other societies or do manual labor.

* Arbor explains that these spy Yaun Ti would inflitrate societies in order to diplomatically strong arm future climate modification. Do you truly know why Port Karim exists in a desert these days. Our ancestors don't remember it as such. It was once a lush jungle of palm trees containing thousands of unique species. Now all thats left are cacti and dry brush.

* The professor explains the history is blurry records are rare and dominant civilizations began altering historical documents. Some conflict occurred between the Sarurukh and Yaun-Ti and then later the Yuan-Ti and humans. About 1000 years ago the Former capital of Ioslend, Lorissa, managed to wipe out the Yaun-ti and rewrote the history as if the yuan-ti never existed. Most people now believe that it was dragons that previously dominanted Oliran, but this can not be the case. No historical documents predating Lorissa mention Dragons at all.

* Arbor explains about 300 years ago Lorissa was struck by a massive rock from space and sunk into the ocean. A massive tidal wave obliterated most of the surrounding area and further altered the climate of Ioslend and Velik. This cannot be allowed to occur again. There a ripples of climate altering in the air. Things are once again changing.

* The professor then enchants Oasis gun and Abor hands Kiko a weapon.

## Chrono Trial

### Location: Cassio's Deathbed - Oraphia

Also in the room is a maple rocking chair and Cassio's Messenger Bag. Inbetween the Side Table and Bed is a small window looking out onto the city of Oraphia. The window feels cold. It seems to be Winter and its dark outside already at just 7:00 pm. This room is on the second floor of this two story building from the way the ceiling angles. The celing is too short near the walls to stand. People can be heard talking outside in the street and the college of oraphia can be seen in the distance with lit up windows.

![Cassio](https://github.com/CGavinMullis/Oliran-Github/blob/main/Characters/NPCs/Generic-NPCs/Cassio/Cassio.jpg)

### The Encounter

Cassio doesn't seem to notice upon people entering. But if talked to will talk back. His air is generally downtrodeen, somewhat regretful as he is coming to terms with his death. Cassio tells a few stories. 

* First when looking into the lamp.
  * Chrono... we are the light of this cruel world. A castle that is built on a mountain cannot be hidden away... Similarly, people do not light their lamps and then hide them under a bucket. Instead they hang it from a rope, put it on a table, or bring it with them and it gives light to all those around them. In the same way you must let your light shine for others so that they can see... *He trails off*
* If discussing his death
  * Chrono, people don't sew a patch of expensive cloth to an old garment. The stitching will fall out and make the tear worse. Neither do people pour expensive wine into an old wineskin. If they do it will ruin the wineskin and waste the good wine. No, they pour new wine into new wineskins so that both may be preserved. *Cassio looks at Chrono and spaces out*
* If discussing Chrono
  * Chrono, If a farmer plants his crop in the soil what does he do after that. 
  * He will tend to it while the crop is small, remove weeds, maybe add fertilizer, but then what?
  * Whether he is away or sleeping, Chrono, the seeds sprout and grow. The farmer doesn't know why.
  * All by itself the soil produces grain. First the stalk, then the head then the full kernel.
  * Chrono I've already planted your seed and tended to the field. There is nothing left for me to do.
  * You must wait for the world to finish the process...
* If discussing the snake
  * I once had a laborer friend who came to me in the night. His child was hungry and he was out of bread. THe wasn't a wealthy man and so he asked me to lend him a loaf.
  * Inside I spoke to myself, "Don't bother me, it is the middle of the night, my door is already locked, im sleepy, and that loaf is my breakfast, go away"
  * But instead I felt pity and gave him the loaf against my innerself. 
  * Chrono, like my old friend, ask and it will be given, Seek these things you wonder about and you will find answers.
* After sometime Cassio instructs chrono to open his messenger bag for he has something to give him.

* Cassio's ghost rises from the body and attacks Chrono
