### Setting
The cove itself is full of crashed ships that failed to make it into Mermaid's Landing. A large broken boat covered in moss, sails tattered is stuck on the shoreline. The tips of Masts can also be seen peaking out of the green ocean water. Palm trees and cliffsides encircle the cove impossingly. The thickness of the trees makes it impossible to see much past the beach. Some small crabs can be seen skittering around the shoreline. The sounds of exotic colorful birds can be heard ringing through the trees. Its almost overwhelming the cacophony of calls from the different species of birds. Many of the birds are vibrantly colored and can be seen briefly as they fly between the palm trees. When the birds get quiet danger is around.
