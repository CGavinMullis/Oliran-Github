### Setting
The cove itself is full of crashed ships that failed to make it into Mermaid's Landing. A large broken boat covered in moss, sails tattered is stuck on the shoreline. The tips of Masts can also be seen peaking out of the green ocean water. Palm trees and cliffsides encircle the cove impossingly. The thickness of the trees makes it impossible to see much past the beach. Some small crabs can be seen skittering around the shoreline. The sounds of exotic colorful birds can be heard ringing through the trees. Its almost overwhelming the cacophony of calls from the different species of birds. Many of the birds are vibrantly colored and can be seen briefly as they fly between the palm trees. When the birds get quiet danger is around.

### Setting
This remote village of birdfolk resides along the brook known as Misty Run. Bulbous homes made of animal hide and palm wood can be seen around the village. An invisible warbling magic barrier exists around the village preventing outsiders from entering. Villagers of the Sqoot Clan entering and exiting the village pass through the barrier as if it wasn't even there. Outsiders considered honorary Sqoot clan members are able to pass through in much the same way.
